# Ridge-and-Lasso-Regression

I had a data challenge recently. The assignment was to predict an interval target variable in Python using lasso regression model. The model performance will be evaluated by two metrices:

* MSE <= 0.23
* R-square >= 0.82

I achieved an MSE <= 0.17, and R-square no higher than 0.74 which is below targeted level. It is my hope to further improve this model here and achieve the 0.82 target eventually.
